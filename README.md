# Python Workshop

Python workshop for **Mentoring Math Minds** community at Saint Louis University.

The Python workshop is designed to introduce the fundamentals of programming in an engaging and interactive way. Participants will learn key concepts such as variables, data types, basic operations, and control flow structures like loops and conditional statements. They will also explore essential data structures such as lists and dictionaries, and understand how to write reusable code using functions. The workshop includes hands-on exercises and a mini-project. By the end of the session, participnets will have the foundational skills to start coding confidently and continue exploring Python independently.

### **Main Topics**  
1. **Introduction to Python**: Why Python, setting up the environment.  
2. **Variables and Data Types**: Strings, integers, floats, booleans.  
3. **Input/Output and Basic Operations**: User input, print statements, arithmetic, and comparisons.  
4. **Control Flow**: `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.  
5. **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops.  
6. **Data Structures**: Lists and dictionaries.  
7. **Functions**: Defining, using parameters, and return values.  
8. **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing common programming errors.  
9. **Generative AI**: A brief introduction to leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT to assist with coding and problem-solving.  
10. **Mini-Project**: Practical application of learned concepts.

## Setup the environment

### Install Python  
To install the latest version of Python on your system, follow these instructions:  
- **Windows**: Refer to [section 4.1.1](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps) in the Python documentation. Be sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation. Alternatively, if you have [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) installed, you can use Python in WSL. 
- **macOS**: Follow [section 5.1.1](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#installation-steps). Alternatively, if you have a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can use it to install Python.  
- **Linux**: Python is typically preinstalled on most Linux distributions.  

### Install Visual Studio Code  
Download and install Visual Studio Code from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
